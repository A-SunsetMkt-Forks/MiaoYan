## Why do this

- I have tried many note-taking applications before, such as WizNote, Ulysses (no preview), Quiver (not updated for years), MWeb (complicated functions), Bear (Markdown images and other rich formats are not supported), for various reasons, I did not find a good Markdown application, so I had the idea of doing MiaoYan.
- My job is front-end development, but also can develop iOS App, love to toss new things, so develop MiaoYan as a fun leisure.
