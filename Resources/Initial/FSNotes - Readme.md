- markdown preview mode
- elastic two pane view (vertical and horizontal layout)
- blazing fast and lightweight
- open files in finder / works with external editors (changes seamlessly live sync with UI)
- pin/unpin important notes in top
- synchronization over iCloud Drive / Dropbox

Default storage directory (Notarized):

```~/Library/Containers/co.fluder.FSNotes/Data/Documents/```

```~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~co~fluder~fsnotes/Documents```

Of course you can change the directory (i.e. Dropbox or iCloud Drive) for synchronization
